# Transform this dict:

# Write a Python program to get the maximum and minimum value in a dictionary.
# 
# # Exercise (easy)
# Print every key and value of this dictionary using for loop, and then using while loop:
# ```python
# products = {
# ‘SMART WATCH’: 550,
# ‘PHONE’ : 1000,
# ‘PLAYSTATION’: 500,
# ‘LAPTOP’ : 1550,
# ‘MUSIC PLAYER’ : 600,
# ‘TABLET’ : 400
# }

# Write a Python script to check if a given key already exists in a dictionary. 
# 
# # Exercise (medium)
# Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one.
# ```python
# dic1={1:10, 2:20} 
# dic2={3:30, 4:40} 
# dic3={5:50,6:60}
# ```
# ```python
# Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

# Use python to convert those two lists:
# ```python
# list1 = ['Rick', 'Donald', 'Mickey' , 'Mario']
# list2 = ['Sanchez', 'Duck', 'Mouse', 'Kart']
# ```
# into this dictionnary:
# ```python
# {
#     'Rick': 'Sanchez'
#     'Donald': 'Duck'
#     'Mickey': 'Mouse'
#     'Mario': 'Kart'
# }

# Ask the user how many money he got, then display products that he can afford.
# 
# ```python
# products = {
# ‘SMART WATCH’: 550,
# ‘PHONE’ : 1000,
# ‘PLAYSTATION’: 500,
# ‘LAPTOP’ : 1550,
# ‘MUSIC PLAYER’ : 600,
# ‘TABLET’ : 400
# 
# }
# ```
# 
# # Exercise (medium)
# Get a number from the user, and then spell each number in words, for example, if the user input 1234:
# ```
# one two three four
# ```
# 
# # Exercise (medium)
# Get a number from the user and create a dictionnary where the keys are every number from 1 to this number, and values are the square of keys.
# For example, if user input `5`:
# ```python
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
# ```
# 
# # Exercise (medium)
# step 1
# Make a dictionnary called contacts and add three of your friends with their phone number
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
#     {"Eyal":"0586878399",
#     "John":"0542815674",
#     "Mario":"0512345678"}
# step 2
# Add another person
# 
# step 3
# Write a loop that print every contact with his number
# 
# step 4
# Write a code that searches if a given name exists in the contacts
# 
# step 5
# Write a code that searches if a given number exists in the contacts, if it exist, then print his name.
# 
# step 6
# Given another dictionnary of contacts, add it to your dictionnary
# 
# step 7
# Count how many contacts are in your dictionnary
# 
# step 8
# Print the contacts in alphabetic order with their number
# 
# # Exercise (hard)
# Write a Python program to combine two dictionary adding values for common keys. Go to the editor
# ```python
# d1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c':300}
# d2 = {'a': 300, 'b': 200, 'd':400}
# ```
# Output:
# ```python
# {'a': 400, 'b': 400, 'd': 400, 'c': 300}
# ```
